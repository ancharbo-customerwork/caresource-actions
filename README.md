# GitHub Actions Demo Repository

This repository is a demonstration of how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automation tasks.

## About GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow.

Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.
